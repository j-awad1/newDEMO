[{"type":"text","text":"which FIBO classes, properties can identify MISMO data point base LTV Ratio Percent "}]
In the Financial Industry Business Ontology (FIBO), the "Base LTV Ratio Percent" data point from the MISMO data model can be represented using the following classes and properties:

Classes:
1. `fibo-loan-typ:LoanToValueRatio`: This class represents the loan-to-value ratio, which is a measure of the loan amount relative to the value of the underlying asset.

Properties:
1. `fibo-loan-typ:hasBaseLoanToValueRatio`: This property can be used to associate a loan with its base loan-to-value ratio.
2. `fibo-loan-typ:baseLoanToValueRatio`: This data property can be used to represent the actual value of the base loan-to-value ratio, typically expressed as a percentage.

To represent the "Base LTV Ratio Percent" data point in FIBO, you can use the following structure:

```
:myLoan a fibo-loan-typ:Loan ;
fibo-loan-typ:hasBaseLoanToValueRatio :baseLTVRatio .

:baseLTVRatio a fibo-loan-typ:LoanToValueRatio ;
fibo-loan-typ:baseLoanToValueRatio "80.0"^^xsd:decimal .
```

In this example, `:myLoan` is an instance of the `fibo-loan-typ:Loan` class, and it is associated with an instance of the `fibo-loan-typ:LoanToValueRatio` class (`:baseLTVRatio`) using the `fibo-loan-typ:hasBaseLoanToValueRatio` property. The actual value of the base loan-to-value ratio (e.g., 80.0%) is represented using the `fibo-loan-typ:baseLoanToValueRatio` data property.

Please note that the specific implementation and naming conventions may vary depending on the context and requirements of your application.
